[unintened_undefined_bug]
In this: `{ ...objA, ...objB }`, any fields in objA with actual values,
get overwritten by any `field: undefined` fields in objB. But that's often not
what was intended.
Therefore, avoid setting any fields to `undefined` (unless the above is the intended
behavior, but then maybe using `null` makes the intention more clear).
